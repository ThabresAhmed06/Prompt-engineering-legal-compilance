        "- The same compliance task—determining whether an incident is reportable, under which regulation, and within what timeframe—is addressed across all templates.\n",
        "- Three different modalities are supported:\n",
        "  - **Text → Text** for written incident descriptions\n",
        "  - **Image → Text** for scanned or screenshot-based incident reports\n",
        "  - **Audio → Text** for voice-recorded incident disclosures\n",
        "- Different prompting strategies are applied (zero-shot and role-based) to demonstrate flexibility without altering task logic.\n",
        "- The system cleanly separates **input processing** (OCR or transcription) from **decision reasoning**, improving clarity and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Reusability Notes\n",
        "- The prompt structure is modular and can be reused for any incident type by changing only the input content.\n",
        "- New regulations or jurisdictions can be supported by updating the system instructions without rewriting code.\n",
        "- Additional modalities (e.g., PDF documents or chat logs) can be integrated by inserting a preprocessing step before the decision prompt.\n",
        "- The same architecture can be extended to other compliance workflows such as breach severity assessment, regulatory classification, or audit readiness checks.\n",
        "- The notebook structure allows easy replication across projects, making it suitable for enterprise compliance automation and academic submissions.\n"
