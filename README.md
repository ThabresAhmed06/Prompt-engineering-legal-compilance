# Prompt Engineering for Legal & Compliance Domains

This repository contains a curated collection of **10 Jupyter Notebooks** demonstrating prompt engineering techniques specifically applied to **legal and compliance contexts**.

Large Language Models (LLMs) can behave unpredictably or generate incorrect responses if not carefully guided. In regulated domains such as law, finance, and compliance, it’s critical to ensure that models generate outputs that are:

- **Responsible and accurate**
- **Regulation-aware**
- **Constraint-guided**
- **Safe and compliant with domain rules**

These notebooks explore prompt design patterns, constraint enforcement, refusal logic, scope classification, safety guardrails, and real-world use cases where LLMs must provide guidance while respecting regulatory boundaries.

##  Project Overview

Modern LLMs can assist with tasks ranging from information extraction to regulatory reasoning, but unstructured prompts often lead to incorrect, incomplete, or unsafe answers. This repository illustrates how to:

- Structure prompts to enforce domain constraints  
- Guide models toward *legal reasoning* without hallucination  
- Separate *data extraction* from *decision-making*  
- Implement *refusal mechanisms* for prohibited outputs  
- Apply prompt engineering patterns in regulated settings

These notebooks were developed through hands-on experimentation and reflect practical patterns applicable in *legal AI assistants, compliance bots, and regulated-domain reasoning systems*.

---

Each notebook focuses on a specific prompt engineering topic or pattern relevant to legal and compliance applications.

## Notebook Summaries (What Each Shows)

### 01 — **Scope Control**
How to define and enforce what the model *should* answer and *should not* answer to stay in scope.

### 02 — **Refusal Logic**
Techniques for prompting the model to refuse prohibited tasks, like providing legal advice or making decisions.

### 03 — **Regulatory Grounding**
Ground the model in specific regulations, statutes, or policies using structured prompts to ensure regulatory adherence.

### 04 — **Hallucination Prevention**
Demonstrates patterns to reduce incorrect or fabricated responses (hallucinations) in output.

### 05 — **Context & Constraints**
How to encode domain constraints and regulatory boundaries into prompt structures.

### 06 — **Extraction vs Reasoning**
Separating raw data extraction from reasoning to improve faithfulness and clarity.

### 07 — **Policy-Based Prompting**
Prompting patterns for referencing policy documents, guidelines, or regulatory manuals.

### 08 — **Safe Answer Patterns**
Prompt design that ensures neutral, professional tone and regulatory language in responses.

### 09 — **User Intent Interpretation**
Techniques for interpreting ambiguous prompts and mapping them into safe, scoped queries.

### 10 — **End-to-End Regulatory Assistant**
Brings together all techniques to build a prototype compliance assistant.

##  Why This Matters

Prompt engineering is not just about crafting wording — it’s about **designing responsible AI behavior**, especially where outputs may have:

- Regulatory implications
- Legal compliance consequences
- Ethical requirements
- Unintended or harmful effects

This project demonstrates practical patterns for *governed reasoning*, *constraint enforcement*, and *safe model outputs*.
